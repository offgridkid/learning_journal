Today, wednesday of week 2, we learned about how to make a form and deal with
events. There's a good amount of new info in here but it all seems simple
enough. My problem remains from the beginning of the week, making the methods
for the calculations needed for the salmon cookies.
I'm doing the journal right now because I'm trying to raise my grade from 58
to 80 in 2 days. Back to work.
